  <p>The Interledger Foundation (ILF) and its community are building pathways to
  financial access and opportunity across the world. We support people and ideas
  that use the <a
  href="https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/">Interledger
  Protocol (ILP) </a>to contribute to an open payments network built on
  equitable access through the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>In continued service of our
  mission, and learning from our Grant for the Web program, we are excited to
  announce the next open Call For Proposals (CFP) to target the creation of more
  financial nodes in the Interledger network. We will be looking for projects
  that want to plan and build financial services.</p><p>Examples of
  consumer-facing services we seek to activate as ILP nodes are digital wallets,
  mobile money providers, banks, neo-banks, and all include these
  characteristics:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Enables money to be transferred on the ILP
  network&nbsp;</li><li>Permits issuing and housing accounts for individuals and
  organizations</li><li>Uses an <a
  href="https://sdk.finance/electronic-money-institutions/">Electronic Money
  Institution</a> license for the region, community, or use case projects will
  serve</li><li>Is designed for interoperability across systems and
  currencies</li><li>Is dedicated to open-source knowledge sharing as a
  contribution to the emerging ecosystem</li></ul><p><em>&ldquo;In our two years
  of grantmaking, we have learned that promise and excitement are not enough for
  our technology to expand financial access across the globe or to solve local
  problems. We are at an inflection point in the development of the Interledger
  Protocol where expanding the network is the critical next step. With this
  opportunity, we want to help Interledger-driven business models flourish by
  building on an open standards protocol while solving real problems for real
  people&rdquo;</em></p><p>Briana Marbury, Interledger Foundation Executive
  Director</p><p>This CFP will support up to 20 projects through a research,
  development, and planning phase. This grant opportunity covers phase one, and
  projects selected in this opening round will be eligible and competitive for
  round two.</p><p><strong>Phases</strong></p><p><em>Research &amp;
  Planning</em></p><p>We will award up to twenty projects $75K USD for a
  six-month project timeline in this first grant phase. These awards are
  planning grants that allow successful applicants to produce a dynamic business
  plan for becoming a node in the Interledger Network. Awardees will potentially
  have an opportunity to apply to the Prototyping
  Phase.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Prototyping</em></p><p>Projects will advance with
  additional award funding to implement their plan and produce a working
  prototype/beta version of their service. This phase will focus on practical
  application and regulatory compliance to stand up a working prototype of the
  node and the capability it creates for its
  users.</p><p><em>Launch</em></p><p>Building from the first two phases, we will
  identify a set of projects that are ready to be operational. With the third
  round of awards, ILF will fund, support, and help launch fully functioning
  financial nodes into the Interledger Network.</p><p>We will begin accepting
  applications for the Research and Planning phase on May 17,
  2022.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We need new voices and ideas in the Interledger
  Network</strong></p><p>We want to ensure that these financial innovations are
  coming from and created outside the typical locales and demographics. We seek
  to support communities that have &ndash; and continue to be &ndash;
  systemically and deliberately excluded from financial access and empowerment
  opportunities. For this CFP, we will increase the scoring of the following
  criteria in our judging process:</p><ul><li>Projects located in and serving
  geographical locations outside North America and Western
  Europe.</li><li>Projects where a lead applicant is a person of color, or the
  team, represents a diverse group of people.</li><li>The output of the team
  benefits communities that have been historically
  underrepresented.</li><li>Funds are explicitly budgeted to address the
  increasing participation of historically marginalized and underrepresented
  communities.</li></ul><p><strong>Key details</strong></p><ul><li>All
  applicants must be a formal entity such as a company, NGO, educational
  institution, government agency, or other documented collective.</li><li>The
  Call for Proposals will be open from May 17 to July 8, 2022.</li><li>We will
  award up to 20 recipients at $75K USD in funds.</li><li>The cohort will kick
  off in 2022.</li><li>All details on requirements and processes will be shared
  when the application opens.</li><li>We use Submittable for our application
  process.</li><li>We will have two open office hours before the application
  form goes live, on May 12 at 12:00 pm UTC, and May 13 at 7:00 pm
  UTC</li><li>We will be answering questions on our <a
