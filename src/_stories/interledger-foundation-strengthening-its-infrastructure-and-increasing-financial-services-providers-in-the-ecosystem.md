  <p>On May 17, the <a href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger
  Foundation</a> announced its third Call For Proposal (CFP) since launching
  almost two years ago. For our friends that have been along with us on this
  journey since the beginning, you&rsquo;ll notice that this Call is quite
  different from our earlier iterations. When we first started our grantmaking
  in 2019, our inaugural CFP was open to just about anyone interested in
  experimenting with the Interledger Protocol.&nbsp; There was a healthy mix of
  developers and content creators working on projects that ranged from web
  monetized content,&nbsp; code repositories, and new platforms experimenting
  with new business models for the web. From our initial cohort of grantees and
  subsequent calls afterwards, we were able to garner gems for improvement each
  time. Through our feedback mechanisms imbedded in the grantmaking process, we
  have been able to determine which aspects of the Protocol our community is
  excited about, and some of the barriers and pain points to entry that needs to
  be eased. So we&rsquo;ve made the decision to build the foundational aspects
  and improve the Interledger Protocol to improve access to the
  network.</p><p>This <a

  CFP for ILP-Based Financial Services</a> represents an evolution of where we
  are in the development of the infrastructure. The feedback from our community
  has shown us there is an imperative need to increase the number of financial
  service providers in the ecosystem &ndash; i.e. wallets, neobanks, etc. With
  the understanding that there are several challenges involved in standing up a
  new wallet, we have staggered the award in three stages.&nbsp; The first
  stage, which represents the current CFP, is to develop a business plan with a
  complete understanding of the requirements to obtain a money transmitter
  license in the chosen region of operation. No matter what country a financial
  service provider is in, there is one given that is constant - regulatory
  requirements. Although the rules and regulations vary depending on the country
  or region, there is an inescapable reality concerning the evolution of
  financial services and the requirements to operate. Moving forward with the
  most promising and thoroughly researched plans, the next stage of awards
  involves constructing the actual prototype, followed by the final stage which
  is a fully functional node on the network with at least one connected
  peer.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re as enthused about the possibility of opening up
  the ILP network to more users as we are, and this opportunity sounds inviting
  to you, please consider applying! The current CFP is open until July 8, 2022
  and as always, we&rsquo;re here to answer any questions you may have at <a
