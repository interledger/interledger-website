  launch of the Interledger Foundation</a>, which represents the next phase in
  the development of Interledger, an open protocol technology that allows the
  frictionless movement of payments and micropayments across different ledgers.
  By advancing open payment standards and technologies that keep people
  connected, our vision is to have a more equitable and creative global society
  where anyone can seamlessly earn, share, buy, sell and trade with anyone else
  in the world. We encourage organizations interested in the Interledger
  Foundation&rsquo;s financial inclusion mission to&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener" href="https://interledger.org/join/">join us</a>.</p><p>Here is
  why the Foundation was formed and ways to get
  involved:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Building More Equitable and Creative
  Opportunities on the Web</strong></p><p>The idea for the Interledger Protocol
  was born in 2015 when Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz, its co-creators,
  realized how difficult it was to make cross border payments. Stefan tells a
  story about an Airbnb host, who by the time they received their payment, it
  had gone through numerous third parties and been subject to a variety of fees,
  leaving the host with almost nothing. He saw the system as being very flawed,
  inefficient and clunky. Having worked in accounting and finance for years, I
  noticed many of the same issues myself.</p><p>By moving currency as seamlessly
  as the internet moves information, payments and micropayments sent using the
  Interledger network are secure, fast, and can be sent across borders in any
  currency. In this way, the protocol, as utilized by&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

  helps to advance financial inclusion by including and integrating people who
  have historically been left out of the digital financial
  system.</p><p><strong>Advancing Innovation</strong></p><p>Aided by the
  Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s Grant for the Web program, innovations in Web
  Monetization are opening up an entire financial ecosystem for everyone from
  app and game developers to artists, musicians, and podcasters, to journalists
  and freelancers. Grant for the Web is funding individuals, projects and global
  communities that incorporate or build upon the Web Monetization standard and
  protocols. As new content, video or gaming platforms are created on the web,
  they create ways to financially support their artists. Two great examples of
  web monetization at work are&nbsp;<a

  Browser</a>&nbsp;and the video platform&nbsp;<a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/cinnamon--spicing-up-video-creation-sharing-and-monetizing/">Cinnamon</a>&nbsp;which
  integrate monetization as a native function of the web. In fact, the Grant for
  the Web&rsquo;s site and community space is web monetized, and the
  micropayments generated on the website and community space are directed to
  non-profit organizations that support a healthy internet &ndash; including the
  program&rsquo;s grantees &ndash; on a rotating basis.</p><p>Once again, we are
  thrilled to see the Interledger Foundation moving ahead, and we look forward
  to the impact that we can have on financial inclusion and Web Monetization.
  There are many ways that you can help Interledger Foundation achieve its
  mission of connecting our global society.&nbsp;<a
