  nodes in the Interledger Network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Supporting
  those who facilitate and utilize open payments for financial
  equity</em></strong></p><p>Through this grant, we seek to support communities
  that have &ndash; and continue to be &ndash; systemically and deliberately
  excluded from financial access and empowerment opportunities. The Interledger
  Foundation by providing grants that total $75,000 USD to up to twenty (20)

  compelling idea for an ILP-enabled financial service that understands the
  problems and explores innovative open source solutions.</p><p>Encourage your

  us.</p><p><strong><em>Build your idea in the Interledger
  Network</em></strong></p><p>Do you have an idea for a compelling ILP-enabled
  financial service? Here&rsquo;s how to apply for a grant to explore and
  develop that idea:</p><ul><li>Use or create a (free) Submittable
  account.</li><li>Complete the application outlining the proposed concept, its
  applicability to the Interledger Protocol, practical work plan to create a
  prototype and preliminary budget.</li></ul><p>The Call for Proposal: ILP-Based
  Financial Services is now live and accepting applications. It will be open
  through to Friday, July 8.&nbsp;</p><p>We will hold three information sessions
