  <p>
  The Interledger Foundation champions advocacy for Interledger, an open
  protocol that permits frictionless payments and micropayments across
  currencies and ledgers, enabling opportunities for broader global financial
  inclusion. Our mission is to build equitable pathways to financial access and
  digital participation.
  </p>
  <p>
  Funded projects range from a coalition of credit unions in rural Mexico,
  tooling to measure impact investing, a program to facilitate cross-border
  small business loans, and other ideas to expand how people can benefit from
  the Interledger Protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
  To build on our mission and goals, we will need more people to experiment and
  innovate in the Interledger-enabled network, so we are thrilled to announce
  twelve recipients of our Financial Services awards. These twelve projects will
  receive funds to cover 6-months of research to explore compelling use cases
  for ILP-enabled digital wallets, neobanks and community platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
  We were thrilled by the response we had to this award program and are excited
  to support these projects as they learn, grow and build in the Interledger ecosystem. It is mission
  critical that we expand the ILP network and activate nodes throughout the
  globe who will open up new opportunities to expand financial inclusion. I am
  proud that these projects demonstrate the diversity in our ecosystem and
  support our core belief that we need the people experiencing the problems to
  be imagining solutions. - Briana Marbury, ILF Executive Director.
  </p>
  <p>
  Submitted projects came through a global call for proposals launched in June
  and were reviewed by a panel of judges made up of staff and partners of the
  Interledger Foundation. Successful grantees in our newest cohort come from ten
  different countries.

  <strong>ENEZA</strong>
  </p>
  <p>BITKE Blockchain Consultancy Ltd, Kenya</p>
  <p>
  ENEZA will provide the general public with the potential to access microcredit
  capabilities. Due to high interest rates and compliance measures, most people
  don’t qualify for microlending services. This solution will expose
  Microfinance Institutions and Co-operative Societies to global Web3 lending
  sources with off-chain collateralization and credit scores. ENEZA seeks to be
  the transformative gateway for these sectors, acting as enablers for poverty
  alleviation, prioritizing women in low-income households and rural areas,
  unemployed youth, and persons living with a disability.

  <strong>MUDA OTC Escrow</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Muda ventures, Uganda</p>
  <p>
  Building an FX liquidity marketplace infrastructure that will ease the pain
  points of cross-border payments, MUDA is looking to digitize the process by
  implementing a solution that will apply the ILP technology to digitize and
  improve the way the current cross-border liquidity is aggregated, managed, and
  utilized.

  <strong>Snake Nation As- A-Tier 1 ILPS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Snake Nation. PYT.Ltd, South Africa/USA</p>
  <p>
  One of the significant current gaps in the ILP network is the ability to use a
  Tier 1 ILP-capable wallet on the continent and the major countries In Europe,
  South East - Asia, and Southern America. While developing such a protocol is a
  step forward in finding solutions for financial inclusion, it also increases
  the financial literacy of the M2 banked, underbanked and unbanked communities
  of the global south.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>The People's Clearinghouse</strong>
  </p>
  <p>AMUCSS Mexican Association of Credit Unions of the Social Sector, Mexico</p>
  <p>
  The People's Clearinghouse is a social innovation project to benefit the
  broader public, specifically rural and indigenous people who have organized
  themselves into co-ops. Millions of co-op account holders have been
  historically excluded from the Mexican payment system. As a result they must
  deal with time-consuming and risky travel to access their money in cash. This
  project intends to research how the clearinghouse can be a successful
  connector for small rural co-ops of Mexico to the Mexican central bank and
  among themselves using the Interledger Protocol.

  </p>
  <p>ThitsaWorks, incorporated in Singapore and Myanmar</p>
  <p>
  ThitsaWorks provides solutions to power financial inclusion, currently
  focusing on the digital transformation of the Myanmar microfinance sector
  through enabling digital payments and building their capacities to implement
  digital strategies. In this project, ThitsaWorks will conduct research and
  development to build a prototype of a connector, which will enable Tier-2 and
  Tier-3 financial institutions, including low-capacity financial institutions
  such as microfinance institutions, non-banks, mobile money, and rural banks,
  to participate in an interoperable real-time payment network. This project
  seeks to address for the lack of interoperability, siloed networks and
  inaccessibility of services for unbanked and underbanked in Myanmar.

  <strong>Cheeri</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Divao LLC, USA</p>
  <p>
  Cheeri helps social purpose organizations, impact funders, and investors
  create, manage, measure, and fund impact-driven projects. Cheeri aims to make
  impact funding and investing scalable through automated reimbursement based on
  impact metrics. Using ILP, Cheeri enables the exchange of social,
  environmental, and other common-good impacts for currencies, including fiat
  and crypto. For example, when an impact funder decides to fund a social
  purpose organization, they can create a dedicated impact token that the funded
  organization can redeem for their currency of choice.

  <strong>Kult's ILP Open-Source Digital Wallet </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Kult (Paginas Esbeltas LLC), Brazil/Portugal</p>
  <p>
  Kult is a social platform for curating movies, TV series, books, podcasts, and
  songs that promote diverse cultural exchange between people and communities.
  With the mission of bringing value to human curation, it aims to create an
  open-source digital wallet that any platform can easily replicate. Focusing on
  financial inclusion for the Brazilian population, it also seeks to integrate
  the wallet with the PIX structure – an instant and free electronic payment
  method offered by the Central Bank of Brazil with over 130 million users per
  month. Although being developed on Kult initially, the benefits of such
  innovation would be much broader, as it would allow anyone to implement the
  same wallet on their platforms and start monetizing people online. Therefore,
  Kult would be creating a tool that provides platforms with an accessible way
  to allow peer-to-peer monetization using ILP.

  <strong>Universal Wallet</strong>
  </p>
  <p>CryptoSavannah, Uganda</p>
  <p>
  CryptoSavannah is a digital transformation company building technology
  solutions and providing advisory services to usher Africa into the digital
  economy. The Universal Wallet is a solution that addresses problems of delays,
  inefficiency, and inadequacy of existing programs in loyalty and rewards
  programs. The solution is a single digital wallet, a simple mobile application
  on a phone where rewards are captured and easily managed. The Universal Wallet
  will also be an entry point to identity, the cornerstone of the digital
  economy, while creating an interoperable platform to facilitate a wide range
  of financial applications. The platform seeks to extend financial inclusion by
  enabling people to have a wallet that accepts value, stores it, and can be
  used for transactions. With the ILP potentially enabling transactions, the
  platform can be used by many entities, from supermarkets, telecoms, utility
  providers, and insurance companies to health service providers.

  <p>
  COOL LION FI aims to secure a full-stack license (money transmitter/electronic
  money/microfinance license) for Francophone Africa through which businesses
  can earn, buy, sell, trade, and share cross-borders. As a node in the

  <strong>AgnostiPay</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Spendies B.V., Netherlands</p>
  <p>
  AgnostiPay's open-source technology allows the community of developers to take
  control of payments and enable Self-Sovereign Payments for their end-users -
  empowered by ILP. The project does not focus on creating a single node within
  a particular country but makes the possibility for developers to enable
  thousands of users in using ILP-nodes for self-sovereign payments, using a
  single piece of open-source code by leveraging the end-user credentials. The
  value unlocked by ILP-empowered AgnostiPay technology opens up the ILP network
  for additional payments. It can be used in many situations, such as
  e-commerce, mobile apps, and fintech infrastructures.
