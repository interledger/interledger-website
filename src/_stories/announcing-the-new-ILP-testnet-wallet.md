  <strong>Build, test, and explore the potential of the Interledger Protocol (ILP).</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>We’re delighted to announce that we’ve started working on a testing platform for Interledger. The ILP Testnet Wallet has launched under the domain <a href="https://rafiki.money/">rafiki.money</a>, providing a safe space for developers to test their Rafiki, Open Payments, and Web Monetization integrations. </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  The Testnet wallet was built to make it easier and simpler to build on Interledger. It provides a live environment for developers to test their solutions, auto-peer with other Rafiki instances, and build on their Interledger-enabled accounts. This is an exciting step forward in bringing the Interledger community together to create, innovate and implement open payment solutions that provide pathways to financial inclusion. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In combination with <a href="https://rafiki.dev/">Rafiki</a>, the service designed for account providers to build up faster Interledger capabilities without needing to develop the protocol from scratch,  Testnet provides a much-needed test platform simulating the live Interledger network.  It allows all Rafiki deployers to connect through a publicly available auto-peering platform, negating the need to build multiple connected Rafiki instances to test payments, with real currency. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The wallet supports the Interledger Foundation, ILP-enabled grantees, and those building digital wallets, to effectively test their Rafiki integrations through play money transactions.  Testnet also makes the <a href="https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/">Open Payment APIs</a> publicly available, currently within Rafiki, allowing developers to build applications on top of Interledger. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Through the Testnet wallet, users can set up an account, make and receive play money risk-free payments, and view transactions. Within Testnet peering relationships, required in the live network, will be auto-accepted to enable people to rapidly test and develop. The auto-peering will respond to any incoming peering request, on any currency, with a similar outgoing request on the main node in the test network. The network initially will comprise of three Interledger nodes, simulating a: 
  </p>
  <ul>

  <li>digital wallet built using Rapyd payment APIs, live already at rafiki.money

  <li>bank built using the <a href="https://www.mozrt.com/">Mozrt</a> APIs that will launch in early 2024;

  <li>central bank payment switch built using our new Rafiki <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a> cross-network provider, launching in November 2023.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The ability to connect, innovate and iterate is fundamental to advancing technological capabilities. Through the ILP Testnet we will enable our users to experience the potential and showcase the possibilities of ILP to new audiences, inspiring them about a future where everyone, everywhere has access too, and equity within financial systems.
