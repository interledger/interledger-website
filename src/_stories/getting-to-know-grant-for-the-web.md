  <p>Here at the Interledger Foundation, we&rsquo;re focused on building
  pathways to financial access and opportunity around the world. At the center
  of this is how we use the internet to connect and share our work, and how the
  world&rsquo;s creators are compensated for that work. To that end, we&rsquo;re
  so proud to have Grant for the Web as a featured program under the Interledger
  Foundation umbrella. In a nutshell, Grant for the Web is a fund dedicated to
  boosting open, fair and inclusive standards and innovation in Web
  Monetization. The program awards millions of dollars to grantees who are
  working to further a privacy-centric, open and accessible Web Monetization
  ecosystem. We&rsquo;re excited to introduce you to Grant for the Web and shed
  some light on some of our most commonly asked questions.</p><p><strong>How did
  Grant for the Web come to be and how did the Interledger relationship develop?
  &nbsp;</strong></p><p>The idea for Grant for the Web actually predates the
  Interledger Foundation by about a year and a half. We first started working
  with Coil as creative consultants in July 2019, with a focus on providing the
  design and program support needed to help get Grant for the Web up and
  running. The program officially launched in September 2019, and we started
  giving away grants in the Spring of 2020. Not long after, plans for launching
  the Interledger Foundation started to take shape, with the idea that Grant for
  the Web would move under its stewardship. At that point, we onboarded fully to
  the Interledger Foundation and started working full time to help shape the
  Foundation and further the work of Grant for the Web as a program under its
  scope. Today, all Grant for the Web activities are Interledger Foundation
  activities.</p><p><strong>What are the requirements to be considered for a
  grant and how can I get involved?</strong></p><p>Grant for the Web funds
  individuals, projects and global communities that contribute to a
  privacy-centric, open and accessible Web Monetization ecosystem. It
  prioritizes innovative ideas that incorporate or build upon the Web
  Monetization proposed standard and protocols. Grantees must either use the
  Interledger Protocol or the Web Monetization standard, or both, to qualify. In
  2021, we&rsquo;re focusing on supporting projects that have a Diversity,
  Equity and Inclusion (DEI) component, which can manifest itself in one of two
  ways:</p><ul><li>The lead applicant is a person of color or the team
  represents a diverse group of people.</li><li>The output of the team benefits
  communities that have been historically underrepresented.</li></ul><p>In terms
  of timing, the first public call for proposals wrapped in September,
  and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/grantees">those grantees</a>&nbsp;came on
  board. Since then, we opened up a &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; call for
  proposals, in which those who didn&rsquo;t receive funding on their initial
  submissions were invited to incorporate our feedback and resubmit. We are in
  the process of opening the next public call for submissions in the second half
  of 2021, so stay tuned for more there!</p><p><strong>How are grantees selected
  from the open calls?</strong></p><p>Grantees are selected by a panel of
  independent judges from the tech, philanthropy, arts and cultures sectors.
  Submissions are judged on project goals and design, openness, creativity,
  inclusivity and feasibility of the proposed budget and timeline. Only those
  projects meeting the award criteria will be reviewed, and all proposed award
  decisions are subject to a legal review to confirm an applicant&rsquo;s
  eligibility.</p><p><strong>What kinds of submissions have received grants so
  far?</strong></p><p>The breadth and depth of our submission pool are truly
  astounding. The diversity of projects and applicants we&rsquo;ve seen to date
  is inspiring and just goes to show the wide range of impact that can be made
  by advancing Web Monetization standards. There&rsquo;s truly something for
  everyone, from those drilled into the tech and writing code on GitHub, to
  ballet dancers, to game developers, to authors working on children&rsquo;s
  stories &ndash; and that&rsquo;s just the beginning.&nbsp;<a target="_blank"

  full list of grantees and their projects here</a>.</p><p><strong>What is the
  Technical Scholars Program and how can I get involved?</strong></p><p>We
  kicked off the Technical Scholars program last year to fund talented
  independent browser engineers who are experimenting and integrating Web
  Monetization into browsers in order to get closer to native browser support.
  If you&rsquo;re interested in building Web Monetization into the web platform,
  you could be a great candidate for this program.&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
