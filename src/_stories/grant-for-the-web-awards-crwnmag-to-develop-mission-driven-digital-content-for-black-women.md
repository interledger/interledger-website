  <p>Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s Grant for the Web announced a $505,000 award
  to CRWNMAG to provide digital content for Black women delivered in an
  authentic voice by a trusted platform. Sustainable <strong>web monetization
  that fosters financial inclusion</strong> for creators will be a key feature
  of the publication&rsquo;s digital transformation, reflecting
  Interledger&rsquo;s core mission.</p><p>The<a href="https://interledger.org/">
  Interledger Foundation</a> is a $100 million foundation that promotes
  innovation, creativity and inclusion through open payment standards and
  technologies that seamlessly connect the global society. Its<a
  href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/"> Grant for the Web</a><strong>
  </strong>program has already committed more than $10 million to boost open,
  fair and inclusive standards in web monetization (WM). Awards are intended to
  seed an ecosystem that will <em>challenge the web&rsquo;s most urgent issues:
  loss of privacy, centralization of power and inequalities in online
  participation</em>.</p><p>&ldquo;CRWNMAG&rsquo;s project aligns with the goals
  of Grant for the Web on many levels, including broadening financial inclusion
  for creators of color through web monetization,&rdquo; said
  Interledger&rsquo;s Executive Director Briana Marbury. &ldquo;This award will
  enable CRWNMAG to disrupt established practices in the publishing industry and
  change the paradigm by deploying an inventive business model and new
  technology.&rdquo;</p><p>The award will be utilized to:</p><ul><li>Engage web
  monetization (WM) to <strong>convert CRWNMAG&rsquo;s print publication into
  digital content</strong> available through WM providers, allowing new
  consumers to enjoy creative content without compromising their security and
  data.</li><li>Pilot a new funding model for CRWNMAG to enable a more equitable
  marketplace for creators and expand from print to digital without breaking the
  trust of more than 200,000 Black women while expanding their ability to work
  with more creators.</li><li><strong>Advocate web-monetization</strong> among
  peer organizations to bring more creatives, entrepreneurs and publishers into
  the WM ecosystem.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.crwnmag.com/">CRWNMAG</a>,
  created by entrepreneurs Lindsey and Nkrumah Farrar in 2015, offers a
  progressive dialogue around natural hair and women who wear it, celebrating a
  new standard of beauty. The publication addresses the whole Black woman who is
  more educated, well-traveled and sophisticated than ever before, embodied by
  cover models including Issa Rae, producer and writer of HBO&rsquo;s hit show
  Insecure; natural hair care maven Whitney White and model/activist Ebonee
  Davis.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Due to the historically and systemically racist
  practices of the advertising industry, coupled with the striking lack of
  access to capital for Black-owned businesses, from the outset CRWNMAG has been
  sustained by a direct-to-consumer revenue model,&rdquo;&nbsp; said Lindsey
  Farrar. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nurtured a growing community of readers who
  understand the value of our stories being immortalized authentically in print.
  The next step is to develop a more robust digital companion, which the
  Interledger award will enable us to do. We are also very excited to create a
  web series on Black maternal health&mdash;a much-needed resource for
  women.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Nkrumah Farrar explained, &ldquo;We produce
  mission-driven content for Black women and it has been difficult to avoid an
  internet powered by surveillance capitalism and algorithmic censorship,
  although these practices are antithetical to our values. For independent
  artists, especially for Black creators, there is a long history of not being
  credited and compensated for one&rsquo;s work. The Interledger
  Foundation&rsquo;s Grant for the Web award will enable us to explore how web
  monetization can help correct this narrative.&rdquo;</p><p>Nkrumah concluded,
  &ldquo;The Interledger award will allow us to seed a new business model that
  empowers creators and enables a more equitable marketplace. This will serve as
  a replicable use case for other digital publications to better serve their
  audience outside of the predatory practices of programmatic advertising,
  biased tech and the tastes of the dominant culture&mdash;a change with immense
  potential.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the Interledger
