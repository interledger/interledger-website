  <p><strong>Payments Working Together</strong></p><p>The Mojaloop Foundation is
  a charitable nonprofit with a vision of universal financial inclusion. Its
  mission is to enable developing countries to design digital financial services
  that are accessible and inclusive to all.&nbsp;</p><p>The Foundation&rsquo;s
  Mojaloop open source software is a blueprint for how to help organizations
  build interoperable, real-time payment systems that enable seamless,
  affordable financial services between individual users, banks, government
  entities, merchants, mobile network operators, service providers and
  technology companies.</p><p><strong>Interoperability is the
  Challenge</strong></p><p>While mobile money services exist in nearly 100
  countries, 1.7 billion people still lack access to digital financial services,
  despite most owning a mobile phone, according to the World Bank's Global
  Findex. Increasing access to digital financial services and financial tools is
  critical to accelerating the rate at which the financially excluded move into
  the formal financial system, especially in developing economies.</p><p>The
  primary challenge is that it can be expensive and complex to build
  interoperable systems that are inclusive to all. The result is that many
  remain unbanked because of the resulting high transaction fees and the
  requirements to be a customer across multiple banking, mobile and digital
  payment platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>By providing a model for how to simplify and
  reduce the cost of designing payment interoperability, countries can work with
  the banks, and mobile money and digital payment providers can develop
  real-time payment systems that meet the digital financial services needs of
  emerging markets and the unbanked.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Building on the
  Interledger Protocol&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Built upon the Interledger Protocol,
  Mojaloop is an open source platform for digital payments, enabling payments
  between multiple MNOs, commercial banks, or a central bank to be settled, even
  though they may be on different networks.</p><p>The Interledger Protocol
  defines a set of rules that enables a network of computers to send 'packets'
  of value across independent payment networks, in a similar way to how the
  internet routes packets of information. Interledger&rsquo;s open architecture
  and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any currency transfer system,
  with low costs and simple implementation.</p><p>"Mojaloop has taken a lot of
  the key concepts from Interledger and is applying them to simplify digital
  payments for the underserved," said Adrian Hope-Bailie, Global Head of
  Interledger at Coil, Interledger Foundation member and Mojaloop Foundation
  Member. "Interledger, like Mojaloop, is completely agnostic to how digital
  money actually moves between participants, which makes it the perfect tool to
  enable seamless money transfers across all networks, geographies and
  currencies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The Mojaloop Foundation is proud of the
  advances it&rsquo;s making with the help of Interledger. The Bank of Tanzania
  is in the process of implementing Mojaloop to serve Tanzanian citizens, and
  Mowali, a joint venture between mobile network operators Orange and MTN, is an
  implementation of Mojaloop that has recently gone live. Its services are being
  phased in across Africa.</p><p>&ldquo;Mojaloop is dedicated to advancing the
  lives of the underserved by enabling seamless digital financial transactions
  without the restrictive hurdles that have been barriers in the past,&rdquo;
  said Paula Hunter, Executive Director, Mojaloop Foundation. &ldquo;With the
  help of Interledger, we are able to positively impact a population that has
  historically been excluded from formal financial systems by giving them the
  ability to pay and receive payment directly from a simple mobile phone, which
  opens up huge opportunities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Financial Inclusion
  Drives Growth</strong></p><p>If these solutions become widely adopted,
  interoperable digital financial services could provide many more people with
  access to important financial tools. Enabling people to use financial services
  helps them take advantage of opportunities and buffers them from risk, driving
  economic growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Boosting financial inclusion could add $3.7
  trillion to emerging countries' GDP by 2025, an increase of 6 percent 'above
  business as usual,&rsquo; according to McKinsey Global Institute. Initiatives
  such as Mojaloop and Interledger can play a vital role in making this a
  reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
