  <p><strong>Innovation in Web Monetized Video&nbsp; </strong></p><p>Cinnamon,
  now in beta, is a new video platform and a tool that enables creators to
  produce, remix, share, monetize and distribute video across platforms, without
  ads. Cinnamon uses Coil, a Web Monetization provider leveraging Interledger,
  to make micropayments to content creators. It also helps artists develop
  engaging and easily shareable content in a very open community-driven
  environment. On the Cinnamon platform, viewers will find videos from some of
  the world's most imaginative and innovative creators.</p><p>Cinnamon offers a
  unique and intuitive experience. The platform needs no instruction manual; the
  user experience seamlessly flows from one step to the next. Cinnamon is not
  positioned as a competitor to existing services, as it offers a different
  monetization model for creators. However, viewed at a high level, it provides
  end-users with functionality similar to what's on YouTube, Vimeo and
  others.</p><p>Founded in 2019, the company is incorporated in Delaware and
  based in Prague, in the Czech Republic.</p><p><strong>Inventing A Better Way
  To Treat Video Creators</strong></p><p>Cinnamon's founder R&oacute;bert
  Tarabč&aacute;k felt that the way creators were treated had to change. Too
  much content was being simply given away, while existing means of monetization
  were cumbersome and not favorable to either creators or viewers &ndash; think
  unsightly ads and access-blocking subscriptions.</p><p>With the launch of
  Coil, which enables micropayments to websites, Tarabč&aacute;k saw new and
  exciting use cases for Interledger, an open protocol suite for sending
  payments across different ledgers. The Interledger Protocol functions as a
  gateway to connect those who send money with those who receive money, and it
  creates a financial route that is both quicker and cheaper than
  alternatives.</p><p>Tarabč&aacute;k understood Coil as providing a
  revolutionary form of monetization. He realized that one of the apps Coil
  could serve would be a video-streaming service that solved some of the
  problems that creators run into with existing services &ndash; and
  monetization via Interledger could be the solution they&rsquo;ve been waiting
  for. And from that striking idea, Cinnamon was
  born.</p><p><strong>Interoperability Enabling
  Access</strong></p><p>Interledger is an open protocol suite for sending
  payments across different ledgers. Like the internet, connectors route packets
  of money across independent networks. Interledger's open architecture and
  minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system.
  Interledger is not tied to a single company, blockchain or currency; Cinnamon
  uses it because it eliminates any central authority.</p><p><strong>Better Web
  Monetization</strong></p><p>Web Monetization is a key aspect of Cinnamon, and
  it's enabled by integrating with Coil, which is based on Interledger. Other
  micropayments models have been tried before, but with mixed results.</p><p>One
  of the things that makes Coil different is the fact that it&rsquo;s based on
  the open Interledger Protocol. Coil allows micropayments to be sent to
  creators on Cinnamon for every second of their content being viewed, while
  viewers watch videos on Cinnamon (and consume Web Monetized content elsewhere)
  totally ad-free.</p><p>"Think about having a card you scan when you use public
  transport. Every month you pay $5 and you gain unlimited access to buses,
  trams, ferries, subways and more. Coil is the public transport card of the
  internet. As more and more websites and applications proceed to use Coil, you
  keep gaining more and more access to exclusive content,&rdquo; said
  Tarabč&aacute;k. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to see Cinnamon blossom into a
  growing source for some of the most dynamic, engaging and diverse video
  content on the web, and we&rsquo;re proud to be able to compensate our
  creators using Interledger and Coil technology."</p><p>Just as in real life,
  when people pay someone for goods and services in cash, there is a wallet (or
  pocket) where someone's money is stored. To receive financial rewards from
  Cinnamon viewers, content creators will need to set up an e-wallet. Coil
  currently uses Uphold and GateHub.</p><p><strong>How to Enjoy a Taste of
  Cinnamon</strong></p><p>Due to the new form of content monetization, Cinnamon
  operates under a different model, compared to other video-sharing platforms.
  To start using Cinnamon as a viewer:</p><ol><li>Set up a Coil
  Account</li><li>Sign in to Cinnamon with Coil</li><li>Kick back, relax and
  enjoy the show!</li></ol><p>With Cinnamon, you will be able to view exclusive
  content created with the latest monetization and human interaction
  technologies, allowing content creators to up their game for your
  enjoyment.</p>
