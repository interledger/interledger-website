  <p><strong>The Money Transfer Challenge</strong></p><p>Coil was founded in
  2018 by Stefan Thomas with a vision to create a better business model for the
  Web. As a Web Monetization provider, Coil facilitates the monetization of
  content by sending micropayments to each web-monetized website while browsing.
  The goal is to ensure that content creators all over the world can be fairly
  and easily compensated for their work.</p><p>Open Web Monetization stands in
  contrast to the existing advertising and subscription platform monetization
  models that strongly favor large advertising networks and content platforms.
  It is simply not cost effective using traditional payment methods to send a
  fraction of a penny for a single article, image, song or video on an
  independent website. And even when the amounts are large enough, high fees for
  international transactions, and incompatible wallets in different countries,
  create friction for both creators and their fans. These hurdles are difficult
  for many, but they hit unbanked and financially underserved populations around
  the world the hardest, often excluding them from being paid for their work or
  being forced to accept painful fees, delays, and risks.</p><p><strong>The Web
  Monetization Model</strong></p><p>Coil is dedicated to providing better ways
  to access and compensate content creators, publishers and small- to
  medium-sized platforms, without relying on advertising or subscription models.
  The company achieves this with an open standard called Web Monetization. Coil
  builds on open standards to encourage competition and ensure compatibility
  with any payment service and currency.</p><p>The idea is relatively simple:
  users sign up for a $5 Coil membership using a debit or credit card and can
  then browse the web with a micropayments-enabled browser (such as<a
  href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/"> </a><a
  href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/">Puma</a>), or by using a<a
  href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/coil-extension/"> </a><a
  href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/coil-extension/">Coil browser
  extension</a>. As they visit web-monetized sites, micropayments are streamed
  from Coil to the website for every second Coil members read, watch and
  listen.</p><p>On the other side of the equation are the creators, those who
  want to monetize their sites. Creators start by creating a digital wallet
  through a service like Uphold or GateHub, and then monetize their site by
  adding an HTML tag that points to their wallet. Payments then stream into
  their wallet as visitors consume their content.</p><p>So how are these
  payments made possible? That&rsquo;s where Interledger comes in.</p><p>The
  Interledger Protocol enables Web Monetization by facilitating the seamless
  transfer of funds. Funds can be sent instantly to Interledger-enabled wallets
  with near-zero cost, regardless of the currencies used. Without the
  Interledger Protocol providing interoperable and scalable payment rails, Web
  Monetization would be impossible to implement. Coil would need to integrate
  with every wallet individually, which is impossible on a global
  scale.</p><p><strong>The Monetized Web of the Future</strong></p><p>Looking
  forward, the future for Coil and Interledger is bright. Web Monetization is
  easy to use, and adoption is growing. Interledger was purposely built to
  accommodate this growth. The Interledger packet header includes only four key
  elements &ndash; the address to send the money to, the amount of money being
  sent, a condition to ensure payments are received securely and an expiration
  date. Keeping the standard minimal helps ensure Interledger won't become
  outdated as payments technology evolves.</p><p>&ldquo;Streaming micropayments
  is only the beginning,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;We see Web Monetization as a
  beachhead for Interledger which will transform the payments industry in ways
  we cannot even imagine yet. We've seen the power of packet switching
  infrastructure in the success of the internet and this same revolution simply
  hasn't happened yet for payments. I believe that using Interledger, it will
  become possible for millions of developers to easily create efficient,
  inclusive, easy-to-use payment applications that move money globally just like
  the internet did for communication applications.&rdquo;</p><p>Using
  Interledger, Coil has the potential to improve the experience for both
  creators and consumers. Ultimately, this will change the way consumers access
  content and compensate content creators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
