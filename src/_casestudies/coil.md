  <p><strong>The Money Transfer Challenge</strong></p><p>Coil was founded in
  2018 by Stefan Thomas with a vision to create a better business model for the
  Web. As a Web Monetization provider, Coil facilitates the monetization of
  content by sending micropayments to each website while browsing. The goal is
  to help ensure that content creators all over the world can be fairly and
  easily compensated for their work.</p><p>Open Web Monetization stands in
  contrast to the existing advertising and subscription platform monetization
  models that strongly favor large advertising networks and content platforms.
  It is simply not cost effective using traditional payment methods to send a
  few pennies for a single article, image, song or video on an independent
  website. And even when the amounts are large enough, high fees for
  international transactions, and incompatible wallets in different countries,
  create friction for both creators and their fans. These hurdles are difficult
  for many, but they hit unbanked and financially underserved populations around
  the world the hardest, often excluding them from being paid for their work or
  being forced to accept painful fees, delays, and risks.</p><p><strong>The Web
  Monetization Model </strong></p><p>Coil is dedicated to providing better ways
  to access and compensate content creators, publishers and small- to
  medium-sized platforms, without relying on advertising or subscription models.
  The company achieves this with an open technology called Web Monetization.
  Coil builds on open standards to encourage competition and ensure
  compatibility with any payment service and currency.</p><p>The idea is
  relatively simple: users sign up for a $5 Coil membership using a debit or
  credit card and can then browse the web with a micropayments-enabled browser
  (such as <a href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/">Puma</a>), or by using a <a
  href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/coil-extension/">Coil </a><a
  href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/coil-extension/">browser </a><a
  href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/coil-extension/">extension</a>. As
  they visit web-monetized sites, micropayments are streamed from Coil to the
  website for every second Coil members read, watch and listen.&nbsp;</p><p>On
  the other side of the equation are the creators, those who want to monetize
  their sites. Creators start by creating a digital wallet through a service
  like Uphold or GateHub, and then monetize their site by adding HTML code that
  points directly to their digital wallet. Payments then stream into their
  wallets as visitors consume their content.</p><p>So how are these payments
  made possible? That&rsquo;s where Interledger comes in.</p><p>The Interledger
  Protocol enables Web Monetization by facilitating the seamless transfer of
  funds. Funds can be sent instantly to Interledger-enabled wallets with
  near-zero cost, regardless of the currency used. Without the Interledger
  protocol providing interoperable and scalable payment rails, Web Monetization
  would be impossible to implement. Coil would need to integrate with every
  wallet individually, which is impossible on a global scale.</p><p><strong>The
  Monetized Web of the Future </strong></p><p>Looking forward, the future for
  Coil and Interledger is bright. Web Monetization is easy to use, and adoption
  is growing. Interledger was purposely built to accommodate this growth. The
  Interledger packet header includes only four key elements &ndash; the address
  to send the money to, the amount of money being sent, a condition to ensure
  payments are received securely and an expiration date. Keeping the standard
  minimal helps ensure Interledger won't become outdated as payments technology
  evolves.</p><p>&ldquo;Streaming micropayments is only the beginning,&rdquo;
  said Thomas. &ldquo;We see Web Monetization as a beachhead for Interledger
  which will transform the payments industry in ways we cannot even imagine yet.
  We've seen the power of packet switching infrastructure in the success of the
  internet and this same revolution simply hasn't happened yet for payments. I
  believe that using Interledger, it will become possible for millions of
  developers to easily create efficient, inclusive, easy-to-use payment
  applications that move money globally just like the internet did for
  communication applications.&rdquo;</p><p>Using Interledger, Coil has the
  potential to improve the experience for both creators and consumers.
  Ultimately, this will change the way consumers access and pay for content and
  creators around the world get paid.</p><p>To learn more about Coil and become
