  <p><strong>A Browser That Serves You, Not Big
  Advertising</strong></p><p>Founded by Yuriy Dybskiy in 2019, Puma is a mobile
  Web3 browser that rethinks how we discover and pay for online content, games
  and services. Today's web is mostly monetized with ads, rewarding big tech
  companies over individual creators. With this advertising emphasis, companies
  have strong incentives to track and manipulate users, stripping people of
  their information while failing to serve the needs of individual creators. It
  has also become clear that the future of finance is decentralized and going to
  change drastically thanks to crypto and blockchain innovation, yet it&rsquo;s
  very hard to use that technology today.</p><p>Puma was created to fix this. It
  differs from other browsers by enabling direct value transfer between content
  and game creators and their fans, creating a great alternative to
  ads.</p><p>As a photographer, Dybskiy had long been interested in how creators
  and artists could earn a living by monetizing the work they put online. He
  took issue with the fact that most browsers are monetized by search ads and
  targeting and are focused on collecting data about content consumers while
  failing to reward the creators. In late 2018, Dybskiy connected with the
  creators of Interledger, an open protocol suite for sending payments across
  different ledgers. Interledger&rsquo;s design caught his eye as a key building
  block to begin changing the way the internet is monetized &ndash; and how
  creators can get paid. The idea became obvious: let&rsquo;s build a browser
  that has Interledger Protocol support built in to allow tiny amounts of
  currency to flow from a webpage viewer to the creator of the page. This
  approach enables creators to get paid when someone views their content but
  keeps viewers&rsquo; data private, a significant departure from the
  traditional internet model.</p><p><strong>Inside It All: the Interledger
  Protocol</strong></p><p>To make the web monetized model possible, the company
  partnered with Coil, a multifaceted platform designed to facilitate the
  monetization of blogs and other creative works by enabling micropayments while
  web browsing. Users can sign up for a $5 monthly subscription that allows them
  to stream micropayments to web monetized sites. Coil is built on the
  Interledger Protocol, which is integral to Web Monetization because it
  facilitates the seamless transfer of funds. Interledger makes it possible for
  different ledgers to communicate; without the Interledger Protocol providing
  interoperable and scalable payment rails, Web Monetization would not be
  possible.</p><p>With Interledger and Coil, Puma can automatically send
  micropayments to monetized sites, across financial platforms and geographical
  boundaries. Interledger is not tied to a single company, blockchain or
  currency, which allows for the seamless transfer of funds anywhere around the
  world.</p><p>&ldquo;The idea behind Puma was simple,&rdquo; said Dybskiy.
  &ldquo;We wanted to create a way to compensate creators for their work and
  provide a viewing experience that wasn&rsquo;t degraded by invasive ads, which
  required rethinking how the internet operates. Interledger makes that
  possible. We&rsquo;ve already positively impacted the lives of thousands of
  creators around the world by helping them get paid for their work and earn a
  living. And as adoption grows, we&rsquo;re looking forward to a bright future
  where more artists can share their work in a safe and profitable
  way.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p><p>Since April 2020,
  Puma&rsquo;s user base has grown more than 35x. Though it's early days for the
  company, Puma has received strong vocal support from initial users and hosted
  a conference, &ldquo;<a
  href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/blog/the-future-of-micropayments-2020-conference-overview">The
  Future of Micropayments</a>.&rdquo; Early adopters include people who care
  deeply about privacy, curious developers and creators looking for an
  alternative to advertising or paywalls for monetizing their content online.
  The future of Puma is bright, and the team is really excited about what the
  coming years have in store.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
