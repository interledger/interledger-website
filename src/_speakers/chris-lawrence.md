session_title: Community Building for Innovation and Sustainability
session_abstract: "If you build it, go forth and seek your community, and engage that community, then they will come. Community building is not a field of dreams, at least not in the way of the movie. It takes work and a welcoming, open approach to encourage innovation and invite your community to adopt the space as their own, experimenting with what is possible beyond what youâ€™ve thought of. There is an art to it that takes more than just advertising dollars. Join us as we explore the fine art of community building, pitfalls to avoid, and approaches to consider."
