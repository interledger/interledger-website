session_title: "Life After the Grant : Letâ€™s talk sustainability!"
session_abstract: "Grant funding is great. It can kickstart projects and innovation, creating a lifeline for startups, but it can't sustain a project forever. Join us in exploring the post-grant challenges and possible solutions and pathways to sustainability. In the process, we will look to examples from projects in the Interledger and Creative Equity Communities that are at different stages of crafting their sustainable pathways."
