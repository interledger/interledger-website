session_title: "Revenue Sharing Language (RSL): a human and machine-readable syntax for profit-sharing and royalties"
session_abstract: "Revenue Sharing Language (RSL) is a human and machine readable language for describing complex multiple-step revenue-sharing agreements between multiple parties in an open and interoperable way. RSL agreements are Ricardian contracts – a human and machine readable document – unlike a smart contract, which is only readable by software and developers. Created with Interledger Foundation funding as part of the OpenVideo.tech project, RSL was conceived to make it easier for independent creators to get fair payouts from anyone monetizing their work.

This session will look at how revenue sharing and payout agreements and schedules are normally used. Participants will be introduced to the syntax, and revenue sharing agreements expressed as RSL. We will look at some of the current RSL implementations (standalone JS, Svelte.js & CiviCRM), exploring RSL’s relevance to the Web Monetization, digital payments and Interledger ecosystems

This should lead to a discussion with participants (who don't need to be technical or legal experts) around potential uses – both promising and challenging. We'll consider some of the possible issues for tools built using RSL, before exploring the draft Variable RSL Syntax which would expand RSL to more complex, dynamic agreements."
