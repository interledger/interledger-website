session_title: "Podcasters, unlock your true creative potential with Web Monetization"
session_abstract: "Podcasting is booming all over the world, but only a minority of podcasts are monetized.

Podcasters who want to make money are facing a cruel dilemma:
- Draw away their audience by erecting a paywall.
- Expose themselves to censorship by partnering with brands or closed distribution platforms.

Thanks to decentralized protocols, Interledger and Web Monetization allow podcasters to sell content, not their soul.

During this showcase, we will show you how to set up a podcast with Web Monetization and Castopod, an open-source podcast hosting platform. You will see that podcasting is the perfect candidate for time-based pricing."
