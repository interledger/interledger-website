session_title: "Central Bank RTGS and ILP implementation: Mexico's SPEI and the People's Clearinghouse"
session_abstract: "SPEI is the RTGS platform of the Central Bank of Mexico, currently serving most financial entities in the country, either directly or through intermediary entities. In this group, we will introduce and discuss the structure of a SPEI-oriented Clearinghouse, based on our development of the People's Clearinghouse, which is meant to serve as an intermediary access point to SPEI for indirect participants. Our goal in this discussion is to collectively identify possible points of intersection with ILP functions. Could such a Clearinghouse serve as both a SPEI node and an ILP node, promoting the interoperability of both structures and thus extending the reach of the ILP network (perhaps in a similar way as Rafiki could eventually interconnect the ILP network with a Mojaloop scheme)? How could an ILP-based remittance order flow platform interact with such a Clearinghouse? We invite all people to learn about this financial inclusion project from a technical perspective and discuss how the ILP could enrich it."
