session_title: "Including GenZ in Digital Affairs: Bowie State University Share-Out"
session_abstract: "Banking the unbanked population through digitized financial inclusion may bring positive change in the lives of underprivileged populations and economies globally. What better way to prepare for such change than engaging future change makers, thought leaders and activists to be informed and equipped with the knowledge to enable a more equitable digital financial ecosystem?

Bowie State University has received 25K in grant funding from the Interledger Foundation to execute an undergraduate course with students exploring open payments technologies, digital financial systems and issues in eCommerce. BSU will also create content for the community and other institutions to help increase equitable and inclusive participation.

The eCommerce course will be offered through the Management Information Systems Department in the College of Business to students enrolled in Information Systems, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Management, and Accounting Computer Science, Security, and Technology. Each student will be able to interact with mentors, practitioners, and open web payment advocates. The course model is a funnel from broad foundation concepts to the role of web payments to foster more efficient and equitable commerce."
