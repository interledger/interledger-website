session_title: "Sharing Funds - Sharing Values? - Web Monetization as a catalyst for social change"
session_abstract: "What are the effects of online content monetization models on users' behavior and content consumption choices? Does users' awareness that their browsing time actively funds creators make them become more socially aware consumers? And how might Web Monetization help grassroots initiatives and activists who struggle with “converting” users from clicks to monetary support for their content and causes? In the past few months, we conducted several behavioral studies to examine these questions (and a few more) as part of a research project supported by Grant for the Web. Our project—informed by theories from cognitive and social psychology and studies on the role of online civic engagement in the last decade—investigates if joining web monetization initiatives and actively supporting web monetized content affects the pattern of users' online activism. The session will focus on presenting the studies and sharing the results and the lessons we learned. Our findings so far show that people are, in fact, mindful of the values and beliefs of the creators and outlets of the content they consume. We also learned that people see online content consumption as a means to support causes and creators they care for and that increased awareness of the monetization of online content affects people's willingness to consume content associated with societal and ideological causes."
