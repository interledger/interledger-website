session_title: "Introducing Dassie: An Interledger Peer-to-peer Network"
session_abstract: "For the past several years, Interledger has been used very effectively among a small group of early adopters. However, it wasn't possible for many developers to gain access to the network due to the difficulty of peering with an existing participant.

In this talk, Stefan announces Dassie, a new open-source project which combines Interledger and peer-to-peer technology to dramatically lower the barrier to entry for developers looking to experiment with or build on ILP."
