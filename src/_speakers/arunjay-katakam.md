session_title: An Open Regulated Global Payment Inter-Network
session_abstract: "The infrastructure to achieve total interoperability already exists to a great extent but needs to be better harnessed. By creating an open regulated global payments inter-network, leveraging and cultivating existing infrastructure, any regulated service provider will be able to send money to anyone, anywhere in the inter-network, speeding up total interoperÂ­ability, reducing the cost of transactions, and providing migrants with an easy and efficient way to digitally transfer money to their home countries."
