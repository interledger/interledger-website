session_title: Open Knowledge and Web Monetization GAP Analysis
session_abstract: "The Open Knowledge community is built by people all over the world, contributing their time, knowledge, and expertise to platforms like Curationist and Wikipedia. Although these platforms are and should be free to access, paying Open Knowledge contributors for their work would help develop the overall Open movement by further incentivizing and supporting the people who make it run.

In this working session, participants will collaborate on a GAP analysis of the Open Knowledge movement to determine if current web monetization practices and strategies could help meet the need to support contributors, and what steps could be taken. The session will result in the creation of a one-page document detailing the points raised in the analysis that can be shared widely within both the web monetization and Open Knowledge communities."
