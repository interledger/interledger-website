session_title: "Chimoney: Financial Inclusion, Accessibility, and Monetization"
session_abstract: "Chimoney is working towards a more equitable and creative global society through an open payments network that connects and benefits each human, regardless of identity, geography, or income.

Payment systems are fragmented and with new ledgers and protocols, interoperability and utility are non-existent.

In this session, Uchi Uchibeke, will talk about interoperability between offline and decentralized payment systems and how Chimoney is unleashing utility and increasing financial inclusion by enabling people with crypto to spend it on Mobile money like Mpesa, Airtime, and more global options that enhance financial inclusion. She will highlight how developers use Chimoney's API to win their payout gateway and unlock the full potential of the payment chain.

Uchi will guide the summit participants to interact with the Chimoney platform by sending out Chimoney for participants to redeem and have the Chi experience. And share opportunities for integrating with Interledger wallets so that anyone with funds in their interledger-enabled wallet can spend them on real-world products and services."
