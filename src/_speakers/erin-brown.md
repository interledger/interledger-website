session_title: "The 5Ps of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)"
session_abstract: "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is a hot topic across multiple industries and sectors, especially since the untimely death of George Floyd in 2020. While strategies, tools, and techniques to drive development of inclusive financial systems is the focus of the Interledger Summit, is that goal possible without a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by actors in the financial inclusion space across all aspects of their operations? In this talk, you will hear from Erin Brown, former Acting Chief Diversity Officer at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as she discusses the 5 Ps of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and how she used a focus on the 5 Ps of DEI to build USAID's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) program. Through these 5Ps, you will gain awareness as to how our ability to achieve equity and financial inclusion may not be possible until that same focus and intention is used to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion within our own organizations (i.e., it starts at home). Erin will also cover a few foundational strategies to level up on our DEI efforts so that it both benefits our organizations internally and improved our ability to promote greater financial equity and inclusion outcomes."
