  <p>The <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization API</a> is a
  nascent JavaScript browser API that allows the creation of a payment stream
  from the user agent to the website. In simpler terms, it will enable a website
  to get paid from the browser.</p><p>The motivation behind the creation of the
  API is simple. The ability to transfer money has been a long-standing omission
  from the web platform. As a result, the web suffers from a flood of
  advertising and corrupt business models. Web Monetization provides an open,
  native, efficient, and automatic way to compensate creators, pay for API
  calls, and support crucial web infrastructure. &nbsp;</p><p>You might wonder
  why Web Monetization hasn't happened sooner. That's a very good question. It's
  because, until recently, there hasn't been an open, neutral protocol for
  transferring money. But today, the <a
  href="https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/">Interledger
  Protocol</a> (ILP) enables a simple, ledger-agnostic, and currency-agnostic
  method to transfer small quantities of money. ILP opens up the possibility for
  streaming money, making Web Monetization possible for the first time.</p><p>In
  2022, many places will store money. We usually call them "ledgers", as they
  are a collection of accounts in which account transactions get recorded. By
  that definition, a ledger can be Paypal. Or Venmo. Or banks. Even Starbucks is
  a ledger. You have an account; the account stores money for you, and it
  records all your transactions.</p><p>The problems appear when you want to
  transfer some of that value stored in a ledger. There isn't interoperability
  between all of those ledgers.</p><p>The <a
  href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0001-interledger-architecture/0001-interledger-architecture.md#interledger-protocol-suite">Interledger
  Protocol</a> (ILP) was designed to solve precisely these types of problems.
  It's an open, neutral protocol for transferring money. Very, very small
  amounts of money at a time, just like the internet, or the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP
  protocol</a> to be exact. TCP/IP is the set of communications protocols used
  to describe a network of interconnected computers, that can transport and
  route small packets of data between them. The biggest public network that
  implements the protocol is colloquially known as "The Internet". In the same
  way, ILP is used to describe a network of interconnected ledgers that can
  transport and route packets of value between them. The biggest public network
  that implements the protocol is called Interledger.</p><p>ILP enables the Web
  Monetization standard to add payments to the Web without being tied to a
  single currency or payment provider, or send payments to other ledgers, even
  if they are multiple hops away.</p><p><a
  href="https://twitter.com/justmoon">Stefan Thomas</a> and <a
  href="https://twitter.com/_emschwartz">Evan Schwartz</a> co-created
  Interledger in 2015. In October of that year, the whitepaper <a
  href="https://interledger.org/uploads/interledger.pdf">"A Protocol for
  Interledger Payments"</a> and the first implementation were released. Since
  then, the protocol stack has evolved and is currently at version 4. ILPv4
  simplifies previous versions of the protocol and is optimized for routing
  large volumes of low-value packets, also known as "penny switching".</p><p>One
  of the side effects of the initial design of ILP was the ability to exchange
  any value amount, including extremely small values. Something the current
  banking rails can't do. It is the reason why Web Monetization is possible
  today.</p><p>If you'd like to be part of the future of Interledger or Web
  Monetization, please get involved. You can join the <a

  Interledger Community calls</a> where we showcase some of the exciting
  projects using the Interledger network. You can also join the <a
