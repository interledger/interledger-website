  <p><em>Interledger and its Global Development Community Will Advance an Open
  Payments Network Allowing for Broader Participation in Economic Opportunities
  on the Web</em></p><p><strong>San Francisco, Calif. </strong>&mdash;<strong>
  April 14, 2021</strong> &mdash;<strong> </strong>The <a target="_blank"
  rel="noopener" href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger Foundation</a>
  today announced that it has formally launched operations as a charitable
  nonprofit organization. The Foundation&rsquo;s mission is to steward and
  advocate for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://interledger.org/rfcs/0003-interledger-protocol/">Interledger</a>,
  an open protocol that permits frictionless payments and micropayments across
  currencies and ledgers, resulting in opportunities for broader global
  financial inclusion. Although the creators of the internet knew that it was
  important to incorporate digital payments natively into its infrastructure, a
  web-native payments feature is still &ldquo;<a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">reserved for
  future use</a>&rdquo; according to its 402 error code. As a result, the gap
  has been filled over the last 30 years with closed, fee-based and siloed
  payment networks, which have helped accelerate the financial exclusion of the
  world's 1.7 billion unbanked people. Simultaneously, predatory revenue models
  such as programmatic advertising and data tracking, combined with the high
  cost of serving mobile ads, prevent millions from participating in digital
  creator economies. By using an open payments network in which anyone can
  seamlessly earn, buy, sell, trade and share, the Interledger Foundation will
  build equitable pathways to financial access and digital
  participation.</p><p>Through funding from its founding members Coil and Ripple
  and its <a href="https://interledger.org/about-us#board">Board of
  Directors</a>, the Foundation will advance and support the Interledger
  Protocol and its open source community in developing better technological
  standards and new business models for the unbanked and creative economy. The
  Foundation is now the permanent home of the <a
  href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a> program, which
  funds individuals, projects and global communities contributing to an open and
  accessible web monetization ecosystem. Coil, Creative Commons and the Mozilla
  Foundation will continue to provide governance for Grant for the
  Web.</p><p>"The Interledger Foundation aims to bring global awareness to this
  amazing technology," said Interledger Foundation Executive Director Briana
  Marbury (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://bit.ly/ILFblog">read
  her inaugural blog here</a>). "And the potential impact would be life-changing
  for one-third of the world&rsquo;s population. By fostering the
  interoperability of formerly siloed networks and providing alternatives to
  traditional earning models on the web, the Interledger Protocol has the power
  to greatly advance financial inclusion and uplift the lives of billions in the
  process."</p><p><strong>Interledger: Driving Global Financial
  Inclusion</strong></p><p>One of the most compelling open payments use cases of
  the Interledger Protocol has been <a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/making-digital-payments-affordable-and-simple-for-everyone-everywhere/">Mojaloop</a>.
  The open source software makes it easier for nations to design open payments
  systems that loop in the unbanked &mdash; making it easy to transfer money
  through a simple SMS text message. Interledger helps make it possible for
  Mojaloop&rsquo;s interoperability layer to connect all users, bank accounts,
  mobile money wallets and merchants in one open payments loop. By removing the
  barriers that have hindered open payments models, Interledger and Mojaloop
  enable the world to better meet the digital financial needs of the 1.7 billion
  unbanked.</p><p>Innovation is already taking place in sub-Saharan Africa,
  where early Mojaloop adopters include a central bank as well as a joint
  venture between Mobile Network Operators. According to the <a

  Global Institute</a>, wider adoption of interoperable, open payments could
  provide more of the population with access to important digital financial
  services, while boosting the annual GDP of all emerging economies by $3.7
  trillion by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We need a frictionless way for everybody
  on the web to compensate and support one another: the curators, the
  subscription services, the content creators and, of course, the users. The
  Interledger Protocol is the underlying technology that will be the catalyst in
  bringing this to fruition," said Interledger Foundation Chairperson Stefan
  Thomas, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://coil.com/">Coil</a>, and
  Co-Creator of the Interledger Protocol.</p><p><strong>Advancing the
  Web&rsquo;s Creative Economy to All</strong></p><p>Aided by the Interledger
  Foundation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the
  Web</a> program, innovations in <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web
  Monetization</a>, a proposed World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard, are
  opening up an entire financial ecosystem for everyone from app and game
  developers, artists, musicians and podcasters to journalists and freelancers.
  Using the Interledger Protocol, the Web Monetization browser API provides an
  open, native, efficient and automatic way to compensate creators that does not
  force them to rely on advertising, site-by-site subscriptions, or tracking
  models. This is especially relevant in developing economies where more content
  creators and consumers are moving online.</p><p>&ldquo;Interledger has the
  power to disrupt and equalize current online payment structures to expand
  financial access and help monetize the work of millions of creators on the
  web. An interconnected payment system based on open standards can provide a
  viable alternative to siloed systems, walled gardens, and ad and subscription
  models. By making low-cost transfers of money as easy and inexpensive to send
  over the internet as it is to send data, Interledger enables a more open
  global digital economy,&rdquo; said Interledger Foundation President Evan
  Schwartz, Co-Creator of the Interledger Protocol.</p><p>As new content, video
  or gaming platforms emerge, they create ways to financially support their
  artists. For example, creators, like Grant for the Web media artist <a
  href="http://annieberman.net/">Annie Berman</a>, Director of<a
  href="http://www.the-faithful.com"> </a><a
  href="http://www.the-faithful.com">The Faithful</a>,<a
  href="http://annieberman.net/"> </a>are using a <a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/coil/">Coil</a>-enabled web
  monetized video platform to stage films worldwide, enabling ticket holders to get access to special
  bonus events and monetize viewing revenue in terms of hours watched. The <a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/reimaging-how-we-pay-for-content-and-apps/">Puma
  Browser</a>, the first browser to natively support the Web Monetization
  standard using Interledger, enables direct value transfer between content and
  game creators and their fans, creating a great alternative to ads.</p><p>"To
  truly enable open payments and web monetization requires interoperability
  &mdash; between data, money and beyond. Open source protocols like Interledger
  have the potential to change this, doing for money what the internet did for
  data and making it possible for 1.7 billion unbanked people to more fully
  participate in the formal global financial system,&rdquo; said Monica Long,
  General Manager of RippleX at <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a>, a
  Founding Member of the Interledger Foundation. &ldquo;Partnering with the
  Foundation brings us one step closer to achieving this vision by creating
  standards for payments that will, in turn, foster opportunities for the
  budding creator economy to monetize.&rdquo;</p><p>To receive the latest news

  Interledger and Web Monetization</strong></p><p>Interledger is an open source
  technology that can send payments across different networks, regardless of
  currency or platform. Interledger is built based on the same principles of the
  internet that move small packets of data from one network to another at a very
  high speed and low cost; instead of moving data, Interledger moves currency.
  Developed through broad collaboration under the W3C, the <a
  href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> feature of the
  Interledger Protocol is a proposed W3C standard that provides a simple way to
  transfer very small micropayments across the internet, all the way down to
  $0.0001, or one ten thousand of one cent.</p><p><strong>About the Interledger
  Foundation </strong></p><p>The Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s vision is a
  world where anyone can seamlessly earn, share, buy, sell and trade with anyone
  else on the web. To achieve its mission of global financial inclusion, the
  Interledger Foundation operates as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization to
  maintain and advance Interledger as a public good in service of financial
  inclusion. Any bank, provider, government office or other entity can freely
  use Interledger when designing inclusive payment systems. Creators, developers
  or organizations can apply to the Foundation&rsquo;s <a
  href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web program</a> to fund
  their Web Monetization initiatives. To learn more about the Interledger

  Foundation Supporting Quotes </strong></p><p>&ldquo;The launch of the
  Interledger Foundation has the potential to advance financial inclusion in
  emerging economies. Just as the internet revolutionized digital communication,
  open interoperability protocols like Interledger can spark innovation and
  democratize access to digital payments. Enabling open payments to anyone,
  anywhere, has the potential to increase economic security and opportunity for
  the 1.7 billion people who lack access to financial accounts and bring them
  into the fold of the global digital economy,&rdquo; said Kosta Peric, Deputy
  Director of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"

  Services for the Poor program at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>,
  a member of the Interledger Foundation Board of Directors, and Chair of the
  Mojaloop Foundation.</p><p>&ldquo;Creating economic fairness and opportunity
  for the unbanked and vulnerable populations is our highest priority,&rdquo;
  said Maha Bahou, CEO of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"

  &ldquo;We are proud to support the Interledger Foundation and its efforts to
  advance a more inclusive web future where everyone, everywhere can connect and
  create as part of the global economy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Interledger
  Foundation and Grant for the Web are dedicated to driving financial inclusion
  by supporting innovators that have historically been excluded as leaders in
  emergent technologies. Open payment networks on the web can decentralize the
  privilege associated with monetizing content and we are excited to build a
  community of web advocates, creators and publishers who are developing
  powerful solutions to control who benefits from the distribution of their
  work,&rdquo; said Chris Lawrence, Senior Program Manager, <a
  href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a>, Interledger
  Foundation.</p><p>&ldquo;Interledger has the potential to revolutionize
  digital payments and change the economy of the web. Along the way, it will
  have a significant impact on access to digital financial services connecting
  markets around the globe. The fact that a developer or creator anywhere in the
  world can simply put the address of their Interledger-enabled wallet into the
  HTML of their website and then get paid by users from anywhere else in the
  world is unprecedented. We are only just getting started in discovering the
  innovative ways that technologies like Web Monetization and Interledger can be
  used to change the game.&rdquo; said Adrian Hope-Bailie, Head of Interledger
  at <a href="https://coil.com/">Coil</a>, Co-Chair of the W3C Web Payments
  Working Group, and member of the Mojaloop Foundation&rsquo;s Board of
  Directors. Coil is an Interledger Founding Member and Grant for the Web
  Founding Collaborator.</p><p>&ldquo;Creative Commons is proud to support the
  Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s Grant for the Web program, which hopes to
  address some of the most serious problems facing the web, including privacy
  abuses related to ads and unethical sponsored content, by fixing web
  monetization and disrupting content subscription services. With the Grant for
  the Web&rsquo;s commitment to awarding at least 50% of all grant dollars to
  projects that will be openly licensed, funded individuals, projects, and
  global communities are actively contributing to a privacy-centric, open, and
  accessible web monetization ecosystem,&rdquo; said Anna Tumadottir, Director
  of Product, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, a
  Grant for the Web Founding Collaborator.</p><p>&ldquo;The launch of the
  Interledger Foundation, the new home for Grant for the Web, will help pave the
  way for frictionless payments and micropayments for individual creators while
  making it possible for consumers to browse content without relinquishing reams
  of personal data,&rdquo; said Mark Surman, Executive Director, <a
  href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, a Grant for
  the Web Founding Collaborator.</p><p>&ldquo;To achieve their financial
  inclusion goals within this decade, central banks and digital financial
  services providers realize that their real-time payment platforms need to
  connect to all of their nation&rsquo;s traditional bank, mobile money and
  financial systems. By operating on Interledger, Mojaloop helps solve this
  challenge. We are excited about the launch of the Interledger Foundation and
  look forward to collaborating to advance financial inclusion,&rdquo; said <a
