  <p>By Briana Marbury, Executive Director</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t be more
  excited to announce the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
  href="https://interledger.org/news/2021/04/14/interledger-foundation-launches-to-build-more-equitable-and-creative-opportunities-on-the-web/">formal
  launch of the Interledger Foundation</a>, which represents the next phase in
  the development of Interledger, an open protocol technology that allows the
  frictionless movement of payments and micropayments across different ledgers.
  By advancing open payment standards and technologies that keep people
  connected, our vision is to have a more equitable and creative global society
  where anyone can seamlessly earn, share, buy, sell and trade with anyone else
  in the world. We encourage organizations interested in the Interledger
  Foundation&rsquo;s financial inclusion mission to <a
  href="https://interledger.org/join/">join us</a>.</p><p>Here is why the
  Foundation was formed and ways to get involved:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Building
  More Equitable and Creative Opportunities on the Web</strong></p><p>The idea
  for the Interledger protocol was born in 2015 when Stefan Thomas and Evan
  Schwartz, its co-creators, realized how difficult it was to make cross border
  payments. Stefan tells a story about a time when he tried to pay an Airbnb
  host, but by the time the person received their payment, it had gone through
  numerous third parties and been subject to a variety of fees, leaving the host
  with almost nothing. He saw the system as being very flawed, inefficient and
  clunky. Having worked in accounting and finance for years, I noticed many of
  the same issues myself.</p><p>By moving currency as frictionlessly as the
  internet moves information, payments sent using the Interledger network are
  secure, fast, and can be sent across borders from one country to the next and
  in any currency. In this way, the protocol, as utilized by <a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/making-digital-payments-affordable-and-simple-for-everyone-everywhere/">Mojaloop</a>,
  helps to advance financial inclusion by including and integrating people who
  have historically been left out of the digital financial
  system.</p><p><strong>Advancing Innovation </strong></p><p>Aided by the
  Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s Grant for the Web program, innovations in Web
  Monetization are opening up an entire financial ecosystem for everyone from
  app and game developers to artists, musicians, and podcasters, to journalists
  and freelancers. For example, the Grant for the Web is funding individuals,
  projects and global communities that incorporate or build upon the Web
  Monetization standard and protocols. As new content, video or gaming platforms
  are created on the web, they create ways to financially support their artists.
  For example, the <a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/reimaging-how-we-pay-for-content-and-apps/">Puma
  Browser</a> and video platform <a
  href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/cinnamon--spicing-up-video-creation-sharing-and-monetizing/">Cinnamon</a>
  are funded projects aimed at natively integrating monetization into the web
  using open protocols and standards. In fact, the Grant for the Web&rsquo;s
  site and community space is monetized. The micropayments generated on the
  website and community space are directed to non-profit organizations that
  support a healthy internet &ndash; including the program&rsquo;s grantees
  &ndash; on a rotating basis.</p><p>Once again, we are thrilled to see the
  Interledger Foundation moving ahead, and we look forward to the impact that we
  can have on financial inclusion and Web Monetization. There are many ways that
  you can help Interledger Foundation achieve its mission of connecting our
  global society. <a href="https://interledger.org/join/">Learn more about how
