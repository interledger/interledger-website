<h1>Interledger Summit COVID Policy</h1>


<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Last Update: October 24, 2022</p>
<p>
Masks are required at the main event venue, the Marriott hotel.
</p>
<h2>About our policy</h2>


<p>
Providing a safe environment for our community at the ILP Summit is of the utmost importance. As part of the registration process, you will need to confirm that you understand and agree to abide by these policies on-site.
</p>
<p>
Please note that as pandemic conditions change, we may update these policies to maximize the safety of our attendees. We will make every effort to communicate changes promptly so that you can make informed decisions about your attendance. 
</p>
<h2>Masking</h2>


<p>
Masks must be worn properly at all times at the ILP Summit, even if you are vaccinated.
</p>
<p>
Masks must fit snugly around the sides of your face, above your nose, and under your chin (bandanas or face shields are not acceptable unless paired with another mask that meets the requirements).
</p>
<p>
Masks must be worn properly, fully covering your nose and mouth (wearing your mask under your nose, dangling from your ear, etc. is not acceptable).
</p>
<p>
Masks must be worn at all times, except when actively eating or drinking. Please limit eating and drinking to designated areas whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
Panelists may, if desired, remove their face coverings only while speaking on stage. This is not required, and panelists are welcome to continue wearing their masks while presenting.
</p>
<p>
Masks are required in all indoor ILP event spaces, including hallways, and high-traffic areas in the hotel like elevators & escalators.
</p>
<p>
  The optional Saturday night dinner and party will be held at a secondary venue, the Orpheum Theater. Due to the fact that food and beverages will be consumed throughout the evening, masks are optional at this venue only.
</p>
<p>
Attendees are also expected to follow venue policies with respect to face coverings. At present, these do not exceed our own.
</p>
<p>
Attendees should provide their own face coverings for the duration of the event. However, we will have limited disposable masks available for people who forget theirs or who need to change them out. 
</p>
<p>
Our Code of Conduct states that we expect all attendees to cooperate fully with our staff, hotel staff, and any local security or law enforcement personnel. Refusal to properly wear a mask will have consequences including your removal from the event, and/or an attendance ban from future ILP events. 
</p>
<p>
Event staff will be dedicated to ensuring all attendees properly wear their masks.
</p>
<h2>Vaccinations</h2>


<p>
Proof of vaccination is not required to attend this event, although <strong>we strongly recommend all attendees are fully vaccinated and boosted.  </strong>
</p>
<h2>Social Distancing</h2>


<p>
We anticipate the number of attendees to be around 120 people, unless the venue itself or local, state, or federal mandates require a reduction. This means that true social distancing will not be possible in many areas, especially hallways and elevators. Please plan your attendance according to your own comfort level and your own personal health & safety needs. Some event spaces will have modified layouts to allow for greater distance between attendees where possible. 
</p>
<h2>Experiencing COVID symptoms</h2>


<p>
If you experience symptoms of COVID-19 or are alerted of exposure to a confirmed case in the 10 days preceding the event, we ask that you stay home unless you receive a negative PCR test result before your arrival.
</p>
<p>
If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 while at the event, please self-isolate immediately and if at all possible, get a rapid test.
