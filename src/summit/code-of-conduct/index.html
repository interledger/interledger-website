          <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
              <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
              <p>
                The Interledger Foundation is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
                experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity
                and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof. We
                do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any
                form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any
                conference venue, including talks. Summit participants
                violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
                conference at the discretion of the ILF
                staff.
              </p>
              <h2 id="anti-harassment">Anti-harassment</h2>
              <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination
                  related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
                  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
                  age, religion
                </li>
                <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
                <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
                <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
                <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
                <li>Invasion of personal space</li>
                <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                <li>
                  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
              <p>
                Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
                to comply immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event
                  organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the
                  event a welcoming environment for all participants.</strong
                >
                This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
                conference with no refund.
              </p>
              <p>
                Event organizers may take action to address anything designed
                to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making
                the environment hostile for any participants. We expect
                participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
                event-related social activities. We think people should follow
                these rules outside event activities too!
              </p>
              <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
              <p>
                If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome,
                please report it as soon as possible. Conference staff can be
                identified by lanyards. Harassment and other Code of Conduct
                violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want
                you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a
                better place. You can make a report either personally or
                anonymously.

                you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever
                action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

                to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask
                you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but
                we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring
                someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone
                and we won’t tell anyone who you are.

                  <strong>Police:</strong> Call 911.

              </ul>
              <h2 id="inclusive-language">Inclusive language</h2>
              <p>
                In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment
                we strongly believe it’s important to pay attention to harmful
                language patterns and an
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality"
                  >intersectional</a
                >
                view on discriminations that rarely happen only one-sided. We
                understand that our list of isms below is by far not complete
                and believe it is a basic start to raise awareness at our
                events.
              </p>
              <h3 id="ableism">Ableism</h3>
              <p>
                Words like “crazy”, “dumb”, “insane” or “lame” are examples of
                <strong>ableist language</strong>, devaluating people who have
                physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not
                from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense
                of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by
                using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to
                communicate.
              </p>
              <p>
                To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read
                <a
                  href="http://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html"
                  >this guide</a
                >.
              </p>
              <h3 id="sexism">Sexism</h3>
              <p>
                Using gendered terms like <em>“dude”</em> or <em>“guys”</em> to
                address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to
                furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We
                strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered
                terms. If unsure about people’s pronouns, we highly recommend to
                ask people directly for their pronouns first and to check if
                there are already any hints provided by themselves (e.g. on
                badges) instead of assuming their pronouns.

              <h3 id="racism">Racism</h3>
              <p>
                Racism is deeply rooted in our society and globally, exists
                among all social classes and is connected to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism"
                  >colonialism</a
                >
                which has a long history of violence, oppression, and domination
                of one group or individual over another group or individual of
                a different race, ethnicity, culture, and their territories.
                Addressing individuals or a group of people in a diminutive,
                derogative, or questioning way based on their (assumed) race and
                ethnic background is therefore racist, disrespectful, and
                harmful. We do not tolerate any racist behavior, slurs,
                statements, or jokes and will take action if any reports on this
                matter reach us.
