  Tiffany has taken on several roles before working with the Interledger
  Foundation. With a degree in Interior Design, 10 years of experience working
  as a wedding & event planner, and 6 years as a studio manager for
  photographers, she has learned how to be flexible and navigate various
  challenges. She works diligently to help make others' personal and
  professional lives simple so that they may have more time to focus on what's
  most important while leaving the details up to her. Getting a chance to
  travel, explore different places, and create memorable moments are some of her
  favorite things to do.
