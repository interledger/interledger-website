  Mohammed brings 20 years of combined experience in application development, systems integration, and IT operations. On one occasion whilst working out of a former employer’s corporate office and observing a shanty town in the distance from the window, he wondered if his company’s offerings would ever make a difference in the lives of the people he saw. He came to the conclusion that it would not and then bid farewell to the corporate world shortly thereafter. Now as a technical writer at the Interledger Foundation, Mohammed is passionate about enabling creatives, change makers, and innovators in building the pathways for financial inclusion.
