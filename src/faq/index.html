  - question: >-
      Why are you forming and launching operations as the Interledger
      Foundation?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>We are launching the Interledger Foundation because we believe that
      everyone in the world should be able to participate in the digital
      economy. This requires the ability to transfer money without any barriers
      or friction and to monetize content on the web, both of which are features
      that the Interledger Protocol provides. In addition, a key piece in
      ensuring frictionless payments and the movement of money between borders
      involves establishing a set of standards that all participants in the
      ecosystem can agree upon. The Interledger Foundation drives the
      Interledger Protocol community toward engagement in establishing these
      imperative global standards and will be the home where the standards live,
      once fully realized.</p>

  - question: What is the Web Monetization Challenge for Creators Today?
    answer_html: >-
      <p><strong>The Web Monetization Problem:</strong></p><p>Predatory revenue
      models like programmatic advertising and data tracking, combined with the
      high cost of data to serve mobile ads, prevent millions from participating
      in digital creator economies. Using an open payments network in which
      anyone can seamlessly earn, buy, sell, trade and share, the Interledger
      Foundation will build equitable pathways to financial access and digital
      participation.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong></p><p><a
      href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> is being proposed
      as a W3C standard. Using the Interledger Protocol, the Web Monetization
      proposed standard aims to make it easier for web creators to generate
      income from their work without relying on advertising, site-by-site
      subscriptions or tracking models. This is especially relevant in
      developing economies where more content and consumers are moving
      online.</p><p><strong>Advancing the Ecosystem: Grant for the Web
      </strong></p><p>Aided by the Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s <a
      href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a> program,
      innovations in Web Monetization are opening up an entire financial
      ecosystem for everyone from app and game developers, to artists, musicians
      and podcasters, to journalists and freelancers.</p><p>For example, the
      Grant for the Web will fund individuals, projects and global communities
      that contribute to a privacy-centric, open and accessible Web Monetization
      ecosystem. It will prioritize innovative ideas that incorporate or build
      upon the Web Monetization proposed standard and protocols. Funds will
      support projects, content, experimentation and learning around natively
      integrating monetization into the web using open protocols and
      standards.</p><p>As new content, video or gaming platforms are created on
      the web, they create ways to financially support their artists. For
      example, creators, like Grant for the Web Media media artist <a
      href="http://annieberman.net/">Annie Berman</a>, Director of<a
      href="http://www.the-faithful.com"> </a><a
      href="http://www.the-faithful.com">The Faithful</a>,<a
      href="http://annieberman.net/"> </a>are using a web monetized video
      platform to stage films worldwide, enabling ticket holders to get access to special
      bonus events and monetize viewing revenue in terms of hours watched. The
      <a
      href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/reimaging-how-we-pay-for-content-and-apps/">Puma
      Browser</a>, the first browser to natively support the Web Monetization
      proposed standard using Interledger, enables direct value transfer between
      content and game creators and their fans, creating a great alternative to
      ads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
  - question: Why is Financial Inclusion Still a Challenge Today?
    answer_html: >-
      <p><strong>The Open Payment Problem:</strong></p><p>Although the creators
      of the internet knew it was important to incorporate digital payments
      natively into its infrastructure, a web-native payments feature is still
      &ldquo;reserved for future use&rdquo; according to its 402 error code. As
      a result, the gap has been filled over the last 30 years with closed,
      fee-based and siloed payment networks, which have helped accelerate the
      financial exclusion of the world's 1.7 billion unbanked people. Using an
      open payments network in which anyone can seamlessly earn, buy, sell,
      trade and share, the Interledger Foundation will build equitable pathways
      to financial access and digital participation.</p><p>For example,
      traditional and mobile payment networks operate independently from each
      other. Sending money is easy only if the sender and recipient have
      accounts on the same network, making it slow and expensive if they have
      accounts on different networks. If you live on $2 a day and your bank,
      school, merchant and family members all use different payment networks,
      you may not be able to afford the fees required to send and receive money.
      This disconnect is why, despite mobile money services emerging in nearly
      100 countries, 1.7 billion people still lack access to digital payments,
      despite most owning a mobile phone, according to the World
      Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a
      href="https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenknowledge.worldbank.org%2Fbitstream%2Fhandle%2F10986%2F29654%2FLDB-FinInclusion2018.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7CAmy.Enright%40gatesfoundation.org%7C7c96b78e14914c1334fa08d7e8a85e47%7C296b38384bd5496cbd4bf456ea743b74%7C0%7C0%7C637233682142803137&amp;sdata=SC0u0nKpm8ZArCXxuQEuiisC97z6J689ErmrUZok2Uw%3D&amp;reserved=0">Global
      Findex</a>.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Interledger makes it
      easy and low-cost to transact in whatever currency or payment network you
      choose, because Interledger is not tied to any one company or currency.
      Using Interledger, you can send money in USD to someone who wants to
      receive EUR.</p><p>This is because Interledger can send payments across
      different networks, regardless of currency or platform. Interledger is
      built based on the same principles used by the internet for data; instead
      of moving data, Interledger moves currency from one network to another at
      a very high speed and low cost.</p><p><strong>Advancing the
      Ecosystem</strong></p><p>More countries are looking to achieve financial
      inclusion by 2030, as outlined in the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development
      Goals. By creating an open interoperable network that allows anyone to
      transfer money across currencies and ledgers, the Interledger Foundation
      can enable global payment systems to design open web-based systems that
      provide financial access to more of the world&rsquo;s
      population.</p><p>Interledger provides an open, frictionless and
      currency-agnostic method for transferring very small amounts of money,
      typically referred to as micropayments. This open network allows anyone to
      transfer money across currencies and ledgers, resulting in the potential
      rebalancing of our global payment systems.</p><p>One of the most
      successful use cases of the Interledger Protocol has been Mojaloop. The
      open source software makes it easier and more affordable for governments,
      central banks and financial providers to design financial tools that meet
      the accessibility needs of the unbanked. In sub-Saharan Africa, early <a
      href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/making-digital-payments-affordable-and-simple-for-everyone-everywhere/">Mojaloop</a>
      adopters include a central bank as well as a joint venture between Mobile
      Network Operators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
  - question: >-
      Is the Foundation Launch Due to the Need for More Open Payments in Light
      of COVID-19?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>The need for a more equitable and creative web was well established
      before the pandemic arrived, and COVID-19 has only added urgency to these
      needs. Regarding open payments, many countries have waived fees for using
      digital payments instead of cash out of concern for the potential to
      spread COVID-19. Around the world, more creators are looking to make a
      living online, especially given the stay-at-home restrictions of the
      pandemic. If the web and its underlying technology already contained the
      infrastructure for universal payments, the world's 1.7 billion underserved
      could be newly served. Millions of content creators could be participating
      in digital creator economies. An open payments network in which anyone can
      seamlessly earn, buy, sell, trade and share is critical to building
      equitable pathways to financial access and digital participation.</p>
  - question: How was Interledger Invented?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz co-created Interledger in 2015. In
      October of that year, the whitepaper &ldquo;<a target="_blank"
      rel="noopener" href="https://interledger.org/uploads/interledger.pdf">An
      Interledger Protocol</a>&rdquo; and the first implementation were
      released, and the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/community/interledger/">Interledger World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C) Community Group</a> was formed. The group oversees
      the development and governance of the Interledger Protocol, enabling
      different member organizations, full-time collaborators and the public
      work together to develop standards for the web. Learn more about how to
      participate and get the latest news on the Interledger forum at&nbsp;<a
      href="https://forum.interledger.org/">forum.interledger.org</a>.</p>
  - question: What is It? What Can Interledger Do?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Interledger&rsquo;s vision is to make sending value as easy as it is to
      send information over the internet. As an open source protocol used for
      payments across payment networks, the Interledger Protocol, or ILP,
      connects all types of ledgers, from digital wallets and national payment
      systems to others. The end goal is to transact easily with anyone, no
      matter the location or currency. Interledger allows you to receive money
      from any ledger, without setting up accounts on many different services.
      The Interledger Protocol is open-source and is not tied to any one company
      or currency.</p><p>Interledger routes packets of money across independent
      networks just as the internet routes packets of information. The open
      architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value
      transfer system. Because Interledger allows you to receive money from any
      ledger, it is an ideal protocol to use for designing real-time payments
      systems that meet the needs of the entire population.</p>
  - question: What are the Financial Inclusion Benefits of Interledger?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Simplicity for end-users to transfer value over different
      networks</p><p>Speed over traditional payment rails</p><p>Reduced cost as
      competition to connect networks grows and incentivizes lower
      prices</p><p>Trustworthiness as tracking transactions and all-or-nothing
      (atomic) transactions guarantee that the value does not get lost due to
      fees and returns</p><p>Packetizing value -- splitting up larger transfers
      into many lower-value packets which increases the network&rsquo;s
      efficiency, security and interoperability</p>
  - question: What is Web Monetization?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Web Monetization API is a way of streaming micropayments to creators
      for the content you read, watch, listen to and stream online. Web
      Monetization is an alternative revenue model for the web, allowing
      creators to earn revenue from users without requiring subscriptions,
      third-party platforms or reliance on advertising. All of this enables a
      faster, cleaner and less invasive browsing experience. Interledger enables
      Web Monetization by providing an open, frictionless and currency-agnostic
      method for transferring very small amounts of money, typically referred to
      as micropayments.</p>
  - question: What is the Web Monetization Proposed Standard?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Web Monetization is a JavaScript browser API that provides an open,
      native, efficient and automatic way to compensate creators, pay for API
      calls and support crucial web infrastructure. The <a
      href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization API</a> is being
      proposed as a W3C standard at the <a
      href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-web-monetization-a-new-revenue-model-for-the-web/3785">Web
      Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.</p>
  - question: How Does the Grant for the Web Advance Web Monetization?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Aided by the Interledger Foundation&rsquo;s <a
      href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a> program,
      individuals, projects and global communities can apply for grants for
      innovative ideas that incorporate or build upon the Web Monetization
      proposed standard and protocols. Funds will support projects, content,
      experimentation and learning around natively integrating monetization into
      the web using open protocols and standards.</p>
  - question: What Are Some Examples of Interledger in Use?
    answer_html: >-
      <p><strong>Designers of Open, Real-Time Inclusive Payments Systems:
      </strong></p><p><a
      href="https://interledger.org/case-studies/making-digital-payments-affordable-and-simple-for-everyone-everywhere/">Mojaloop</a>:
      Named after the Swahili word for &ldquo;one,&rdquo; Mojaloop is a
      reference model for payment interoperability between services and
      providers. This interconnectedness, within an economy, can reduce barriers
      to customer access and potential transaction volume, as well as increase
      opportunities for low-income individuals to access services that are
      traditionally out of reach.</p><p>In Africa, Mojaloop, which operates
      using Interledger, was adopted by the Bank of Tanzania and Mowali (a joint
      venture between Orange and MTN) to advance inclusive payment models in the
      countries they serve.</p><p><strong>Content

  - question: Does Interledger Utilize Blockchain?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>The Interledger Protocol is not based on blockchain, but it uses some
      key concepts from blockchain technology, such as a decentralized design
      and cryptography-based security.</p><p>According to the Interledger <a
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://interledger.org/uploads/interledger.pdf">white paper</a>,
      one of the most important objectives of the Protocol has always been to
      create the necessary conditions so that &ldquo;any ledger can integrate to
      this Protocol simply by enabling escrowed transfers. Unlike previous
      approaches, the Interledger Protocol does not rely on any global
      coordinating system or ledger for processing payments &ndash; centralized
      or decentralized.&rdquo;</p>
  - question: How can Developers Contribute to Interledger Open Source Software?
    answer_html: >-
